Core
    * Added user/role profile config files located in nagvis/etc/profiles/(user|role).profile
      The profile files can contain user/role specific options like languages and so on
    * The language of a user is stored in the profile file now
    * Added new options {file_group} and {file_mode} to global section of nagvis.ini.php.
      These options are used whenever a file is written by NagVis
    * Livestatus backend: Better error handling when writing to livestatus socket
    * Lines can have three coords now to reposition the middle of lines having
      two arrows
    * Better handling for map config errors on overview page and map links -
      no whole screen errors anymore
  * Refactored map configuration parsing code
  * Reimplemented maintenance mode: in_maintenance=1 is working again

    to update livestatus to the newest 1.1.9i* version.
  * All map objects need to have an object id which needs to be unique on
    each map. All map objects which have no object id defined will ge one
    created. This makes migration easier.

    available

      the "Open" label in the header menu. The state of the sidebar and the
      single nodes is stored in user specific profile files
    * Added new parameter {parent_map} to map/automap global sections which is
      used in header/sidebar menus to draw a map hierarchy
    * Colors and ranges of weathermap lines are now customizable using the
      object configuration option line_weather_colors
