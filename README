# NagVis - Visualization addon for your open source monitoring core 

NagVis is a program for visualizing the data the monitoring core of your choice,
for example Nagios, Naemon, Icinga or Shinken, in a human friendly way. Instead
of rendering all your data in flat tables of hosts and service data which do
not tell the user anything about relations between the object, in NagVis you
can create a view on your objects which makes even non technical users
understand the relations beteen your systems and services. This way visualized
it is easy for the users to realize which components are affected by an
occuring problem.

## Installation

### OMD

There are different ways to install NagVis. The *best* way to an easily
maintainable monitoring environment is to use [OMD](http://omdistro.org), the
Open Monitoring Distribution. Everything you need comes in a single package.
You will be ready to monitor within just a couple of minutes.

# Manual installation

The *classic* way is to install NagVis is to use the installer script which
will ask you a couple of questions and then tries to do the right thing to
provide you with a working installation.

1. Get NagVis (releases can be found on [nagvis.org](http://nagvis.org/))
2. Unpack NagVis

Unpack the archive to a temporary place (for example /tmp), then change to
that directory.

```
# tar xvzf nagvis-1.*.tar.gz /tmp
# cd /tmp/nagvis-1.*
```

3. Run the installer and follow the instructions

```
# ./install.sh
```

4. Now you can remove the source directory

```
# rm -rf /tmp/nagvis-1.*
```

*Hint:* The installer can be called with command line parameters to e.g.
avoid interactive questions during installation. For details launch the
installer with the `-h` option.
