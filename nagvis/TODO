Todo for 0.9a6:
- service ack's (must all services acked for becoming a ack-icon in nagvis. fix it) (martin)
- add checkclass and ischecked for nagvis and config-tool (martin)
- If a CRITICAL State in an hostgroup is a ACKed and a WARNING state occurs, CRITICAL gets display, but it should be only WARNING (martin ???)
- Upload a GOOD default Config and dont break it afterwards (andreas)
- Implement a little "config backup" function somewhere. (guillaume ???) (we have to decide for this)
- Implement some hint in the config tool if called without map parameter (something like "do a rightclick" or so) (not guillaume :-) )
- Convert all variables in the config.inc.php into ONE format (not one startet with uppercase letters, other started with lowercase as it is now) (???)
- bug to fix (german 'umlaute') in langfiles/javascript. (martin)
- create README/INSTALL-file
