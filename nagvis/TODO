- add checkclass and ischecked for nagvis and config-tool (martin)
- If a CRITICAL State in an hostgroup is a ACKed and a WARNING state occurs, CRITICAL gets display, but it should be only WARNING (martin ???)
- Upload a GOOD default Config and dont break it afterwards (andreas)
- Remove Map 1 and replace with a working demo Map wich is set as default in the main config (andreas)
- Implement separeted read an write permissons (???)
- Implement a little "config backup" function somewhere. (guillaume ???)
- Implement some hint in the config tool if called without map parameter (something like "do a rightclick" or so) (guillaume)
- Convert all variables in the config.inc.php into ONE format (not one startet with uppercase letters, other started with lowercase as it is now) (???)
