Todo:
- PRIO 1: please give not to many permissions in the readme. instead 777 use the webserver-group together with 665.
- PRIO 2: add checkclass for config-tool (guillaume)
- PRIO 2: If a CRITICAL State in an hostgroup is a ACKed and a WARNING state occurs, CRITICAL gets display, but it should be only WARNING (martin ???)
- PRIO 3: Implement a little "config backup" function somewhere. (guillaume ???) (we have to decide for this)
- PRIO 3: Implement some hint in the config tool if called without map parameter (something like "do a rightclick" or so) (not guillaume :-) )
- PRIO 2: Convert all variables in the config.inc.php into ONE format (not one startet with uppercase letters, other started with lowercase as it is now) (???)
- FIX: if map.cfg is not writable, print out a error-box (guillaume ???)
