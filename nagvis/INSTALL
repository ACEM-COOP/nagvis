Status: not reviewd

Some uncomplete hints to get the current NagVis test release running. Better Documentation
will be available when we reach FINAL.

STEP 0
------
Make sure your System meets the requirements:
- Nagios is running and authentication is configured (.htaccess file placed and configured properly!)
- Working PHP installation (Version > 4.2.0) with "php-gd" support
- php-mysql support is needed for the strongly recommended "ndomy" backend


STEP 1
------
Get NagVis, the latest test release can be found at http://luebben-home.de/forum/thread.php?threadid=3072
Additional hints will be post there also.


STEP 2
------
Place the NagVis directory tree into your Nagios share Folder
(usally /usr/local/nagios/share).


STEP 3
------
DONT move any files or folders inside the NagVis directory! (In fact you can move,
but in this case you have to change the main config file - if everything is left
untouched it should run "out of the box" without changes to the config)


STEP 4
------
Read the "NagVis 0.9 Main Config Format Description" file on www.nagvis.org and
check your file to fit your Nagios installation.



STEP 5
------
Make sure that the Webserver User can write to the NagVis etc directory and check out the Pathes to awk, cat etc. at wui/wui.function.inc.bash.

E.g. issue the following as root (change pathes according to your installation) :
chmod 665 -R /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/etc/maps/
chmod 665 -R /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/maps/
chmod +x /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/wui/*.bash
chmod 666 /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/etc/config.inc.php

(You can even set less than 666 if you know what you're doing and the groups are set fine)

STEP 6
------
If you want to use the STRONGLY EXPERIMENTAL Config Tool
call http://[nagiosserver]/[path_to_nagvis]/config.php and do a right-click

You should now be able to create new config files. (Make sure the Webserver
can write to the etc directory!). I recommend to backup your created files, it
is alpha so it is possible that some unplanned things happen and srew up you files ;-)

If this does not work: Simply edit the Map config files in the etc/maps/ directory by hand,
see "Map Config File Format" document at www.nagvis.org for doing this.

STEP 7
------
You can use your maps with: http://[nagiosserver]/[path_to_nagvis]/index.php?map=[map
name]

Have fun and report bugs!
