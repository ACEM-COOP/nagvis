Some uncomplete hints to get the current NagVis alhpa running. Better Documentation
will be available when we enter beta state.


STEP 0
------
Make sure your System meets the requirements:
- Nagios is running and authentication is configured
- Working PHP installation (Version > 4.2.0) with "php-gd" support


STEP 1
------
Get NagVis, pull it from CVS or download a nightly tar.


STEP 2
------
Place the NagVis directory tree into your Nagios share Folder
(usally /usr/local/nagios/share).


STEP 3
------
DONT move any files or folders inside the NagVis directory! (In fact you can move,
but in this case you have to change the main config file - if everything is left
untouched it should run "out of the box" without changes to the config)


STEP 4
------
Read the "NagVis 0.9 Main Config Format Description" file on www.nagvis.org and
check your file to fit your Nagios installation.



STEP 5
------

check out the Pathes to awk, cat etc. in /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/wui/wui.function.inc.bash.

As root, launch :
chmod 777 -R /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/etc/maps/
chmod 777 -R /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/maps/
chmod +x /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/wui/*.bash
chmod 666 /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis/etc/config.inc.php



STEP 6
------
Call http://[nagiosserver]/[path_to_nagvis]/config.php and do a right-click

You should now be able to create new config files. (Make sure the Webserver
can write to the etc directory!). I recommend to backup your created files, it
is alpha so it is possible that some unplanned things happen and srew up you files ;-)

You can use your maps with: http://[nagiosserver]/[path_to_nagvis]/index.php?map=[mapname]

Have fun and report bugs!
