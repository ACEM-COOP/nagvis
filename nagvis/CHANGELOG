- renamed everthing to decide between FRONTEND and BACKEND
- made shure that other backens than html will work
- implemented an example (only simple host states) for an NDO MySql DB based Backend
- Started normalising the code as described in Martins schema, additonally Objects
  are written UPPERCASES and I STARTED vars with a lowercase letter

	so now we have

		Var:		textTextText
		Classes:	texttexttext
		Objects:	TEXTTEXTTEXT

    I used a tabs as described by Martin and used tab "size" of 4 characters, please
	configure your editors to do so also, so that "tab" is "tab" on every of our systems

o god, so little work in more than six hours, im just to slow... its much to left...

- added empty state-classes (SEE: $StateClass in config.inc.php)
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_dbmy.php
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_dbpg.php
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_xml.php
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_html.php (old class.checkState.php)
- fixed host-acks
- fixed service-acks
  - $this->findStateHost added for checking if the host is acked
  - problem: parsing-performance, cgi puts different text :/
- begin normalizing the code (many work!!!): variables, classes, format PLEASE READ:
  - 1. classes:		classes written downcase. 

			Examples:
			new checkit, new nagvis, new newclass

  - 2. vars: 		vars for each word the first letter uppercase
		
			Examples:
			$CheckIt = checkit->check_blabla();
			$NagVis = nagvis->blablubb();

  - 3. text-printing:	first write the text in a var, then put it out

			Examples:
			$html .= "<html>
				  <head>
				   <title>
				  </head>";
			.::CODE::.
			$html .= "<body>
				   <table>
				    <tr>
				     <td>blabla</td>
				    </tr>
				   </table>
				  </body>
				  </html>";
			print $html;
  - 4. code-view:	use as logical seperator <TAB> and not whitespace
			
			Examples:
			for($i=0;$i<100;$i++) {
				print $i;
			}

  - 5. conditions:	for conditions open the anchor as follows
		
			Examples:
			if(isset($myvar)) {
				echo "blabla";
			}	
		
  - 6. class-file 	same as the variable
			
			Examples:
			class.CheckIt.php
			class.NagVis.php
			class.ReadFiles.php

  - 7. php-files	normal php files are written downcase.
