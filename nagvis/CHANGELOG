- added check at the NDO Backend to make sure that Nagios is alive and data are up to date
  (something like this should be done at the HTML backend too).
  errorboxes for this have to be done.
- made some security checks to the map parameter given by the user (its the only paramter 
  wich is given directly from outside, so a path exploid or sql injection etc. is theoretically
  possible). slashes, backslashes and php tags are filtered now. 
  something like this should be done to all wui fields too!
- added error message 17 (*.cfg files not writable by the webserver) in german and english
- deleted unneeded files

- renamed everthing to decide between FRONTEND and BACKEND
- made shure that other backens than html will work
- implemented an example (only simple host states) for an NDO MySql DB based Backend
- Started normalising the code as described in Martins schema, additonally Objects
  are written UPPERCASES and I STARTED vars with a lowercase letter

	so now we have

		Var:		textTextText
		Classes:	texttexttext
		Objects:	TEXTTEXTTEXT

    I used a tabs as described by Martin and used tab "size" of 4 characters, please
	configure your editors to do so also, so that "tab" is "tab" on every of our systems

o god, so little work in more than six hours, im just to slow... its much to left...

- added empty state-classes (SEE: $StateClass in config.inc.php)
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_dbmy.php
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_dbpg.php
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_xml.php
  - includes/classes/class.CheckState_html.php (old class.checkState.php)
- fixed host-acks
- fixed service-acks
  - $this->findStateHost added for checking if the host is acked
  - problem: parsing-performance, cgi puts different text :/
- begin normalizing the code (many work!!!): variables, classes, format PLEASE READ:
  - 1. classes:		classes written downcase. 

			Examples:
			new checkit, new nagvis, new newclass

  - 2. vars: 		vars for each word the first letter uppercase
		
			Examples:
			$CheckIt = checkit->check_blabla();
			$NagVis = nagvis->blablubb();

  - 3. text-printing:	first write the text in a var, then put it out

			Examples:
			$html .= "<html>
				  <head>
				   <title>
				  </head>";
			.::CODE::.
			$html .= "<body>
				   <table>
				    <tr>
				     <td>blabla</td>
				    </tr>
				   </table>
				  </body>
				  </html>";
			print $html;
  - 4. code-view:	use as logical seperator <TAB> and not whitespace
			
			Examples:
			for($i=0;$i<100;$i++) {
				print $i;
			}

  - 5. conditions:	for conditions open the anchor as follows
		
			Examples:
			if(isset($myvar)) {
				echo "blabla";
			}	
		
  - 6. class-file 	same as the variable
			
			Examples:
			class.CheckIt.php
			class.NagVis.php
			class.ReadFiles.php

  - 7. php-files	normal php files are written downcase.
