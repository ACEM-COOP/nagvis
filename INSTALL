------------------------------------------

Applies to: NagVis 1.2
------------------------------------------

STEP 0: Prepair System
------
Make sure your System meets the requirements:
- Nagios is running and authentication is configured (.htaccess file placed and 
configured properly!)
- Working PHP installation (Version > 4.2.0) with "php-gd" support
- php-mysql support is needed for the strongly recommended "ndomy" backend

STEP 1: Download NagVis
------
Get NagVis, the latest release can be found at www.nagvis.org

STEP 2: Unpack NagVis
------
Unpack NagVis in a path of your choice

> tar xvzf nagvis-1.x.tar.gz

STEP 3: Configure NagVis
------
Run ./configure --help, check if you need some of the options to change the default
values to fit your needs.

If you don't need to change the defaults run

> ./configure

If the command is completed, check the full output for errors especialy have a look
at the last lines.

STEP 4: Install NagVis
------
If the output of the configure command is OK, run make

> make all
> make install

Now, if make completes without errors, NagVis is installed in the path you wanted it to.

You can also run make again to install sample configurations

> make install-config
> make install-maps

Now the sample config files are also installed in your NagVis folder.

The most lines in the fresh copied config.ini are commented out. If you want to set 
different settings, than there are set, uncomment the line and change the value of it.

For informations about the possible values have a look at Main Config Format Description 
on NagVis.org (http://www.nagvis.org/docs).

STEP 5: The WUI
------
NagVis has an included web based config tool called WUI. If you want to use it 
use your browser to open the page:

	http://<nagiosserver>/<path-to-nagvis>/config.php

Hint: If you have some script or popup blockers, disable them for the WUI.

When you see the NagVis image, right click on it, a context menu should open, 
now you can configure NagVis and create maps with the WUI.

The Config Tools DOES NOT display the current Nagios States of Objects configured.
Its only for configuring! To "use" your configured Maps afterwards see STEP 7!

If this does't work for you, or if you don't want to use the WUI, you can simply 
edit the map config files in the nagvis/etc/maps/ directory with your favorite text 
editor. For valid format and values have a look at Map Config Format Description on 
NagVis.org (http://www.nagvis.org/docs).

STEP 6: Watch the Maps
------
You should now be able to watch your defined maps in your browser:

	http://<nagiosserver>/<path-to-nagvis>/index.php?map=<mapname>

Have fun and please report bugs!
