        <h1>NagVis Geomap</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The NagVis Geomap map source was introduced in NagVis 1.7. It has been developed to get well rendered
        and scaled overview maps without much work.</p>
        <p>The geomap renders several hosts on a <a href="">Open Street Map</a> powered map which is used
        as background image.</p>
        <p>For the current geomap all you need is a CSV file which tells NagVis the hosts to render and
        the geo coordinates where the hosts should be positioned at.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>There is no special software needed on the NagVis host. But there is one special requirement. To
        be able to use this feature, NagVis needs to be able to access the host <code>dev.openstreetmap.org</code>
        via port 80. NagVis uses a simple HTTP based API to get the map image and the coordinates of that image.</p>
        <p>In most cases the NagVis host does not have direct internet access. You can configure the <code>http_proxy</code>
        option in the <code>[global]</code> section of your NagVis main configuration to tell NagVis to use
         a proxy such requests.</p>
        
        <h2>The first call</h2>
        <p>NagVis comes with a demo geomap called "demo-geomap". If your NagVis is configured correctly
        you should see a map of germany with two nodes. One node is showing the host "ham-srv1" in Hamburg.
        The other host "muc-srv1" is located in Munich.</p>

        <p>The geomap is defined using the regular map configuration file "demo-geomap.cfg". The contents
        look like this:</p>
        
        <pre>global {
    sources=geomap
    alias=Demo: 4 Geomap
    parent_map=demo-overview
    iconset=std_medium
    backend_id=demo
    # Geomap Parameters
    source_file=demo-locations
    width=800
    height=600
}</pre>

        <p>The <code>sources=geomap</code> line tells the map to use the geomap source for altering the
        map configuration. The <code>source_file=demo-locations</code> definition tells the geomap source
        to use the file <code>demo-locations.csv</code> located in the <code>etc/geomap</code> directory.</p>

        <p>The <code>demo-locations.csv</code> file contains the following two lines:</p>

        <code>ham-srv1;Hamburg Server 1;53.556866;9.994622
muc-srv1;Munich Server1;48.1448353;11.5580067</code>

        <p>Each line defines one host to be added to the map. The columns are separated by <code>;</code> signs.
        The first colmn contains the host-name, the second an optional alias, the third the LAT coordinate and
        the fourth then LONG coordinate.</p>
        
        <h2>Configuring geomaps</h2>
        <p>There are no special map attributes for the geomaps. The geomap source uses view parameters for
        configuration. For details take a look at the modify view dialog which can be opened using the header
        menu "Actions -> Modify view".</p>
