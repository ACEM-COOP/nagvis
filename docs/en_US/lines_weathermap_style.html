	<h1>Weathermap style lines in NagVis (<font color="#ff0000">New in 1.5.</font>)</h1>

	<p>By default NagVis can only visualize the normal states in lines using red, yellow
     and green colored lines. You may ever wanted NagVis to display nice weathermap style lines?</p>

	<h2>More colorful lines</h2>
	<img style="margin:20px;" src="../general/img/sample-weathermap.jpg" align="right" alt="NagVis Weathermap style lines" />
	<p>Since NagVis 1.5 it is possible to draw such weathermap style lines which
		 can have more than three colors depending on the current load of e.g. the
		 network interface you like to visualize. There can be a wide color range
		 of e.g. seven different colors. Take a look at the example image - isn't that beautiful?.</p>

	<h2>Focus on bandwidth visualization</h2>
	<p>The new lines are focused on bandwidth visualization. Since NagVis needs to parse the
     performance data to gather the current color for the line there are special requirements
     on the performance data contents. There is a bandwidth measurement plugin for Nagios which
		 comes with the correct performance data informations out of the box. It is downloadable
		 from <a href="http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Network-Connections%2C-Stats-and-Bandwidth/check_iftraffic3/details" target="_blank">Nagios Exchange</a>.</p>

	<h2>Weathermap line types</h2>
	<p>The weathermap style lines currently provide two types of lines:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>---%-->&lt;--%----</code>: Arrows with percentage labels in the middle of the line.</li>
		<li><code>---%+BW-->&lt;--%+BW---</code>: Arrows with percentage labels in the middle of the line and additional labels which display the current bandwidth usage.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How to create weathermap lines?</h2>
	<p>To create weathermap style lines in NagVis you need services which send the correct
		 performance data to Nagios. If you got some simply place a line service object on the
		 map and choose the correct line type. Now take a look at your map - it should work now.</p>

	<p>You may want to have a legend which shows you the meaning of the different colors.
		 No problem. Simply add a shape to your map and choose the &quot;demo_traffic_load_legend&quot;
		 shape which is delivered with the NagVis core package.</p>

	<p>Thanks to gjfrater for implementing these lines!</p>
