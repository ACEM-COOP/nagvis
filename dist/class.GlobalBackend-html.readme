NagVis HTML Backend 

Since NagVis 1.x release, the use of the HTML-Backend is not longer recommended.
There are severals bugs and performance issues in this Backend, so we decided
to publish the NDO backend as the default.

If you want to use this backend, copy it to the following folder:
nagvis/includes/classes

Now you can add a Backend to the config.ini.php using the type "html".
